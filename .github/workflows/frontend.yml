      # Deployment to Vercel/Render is typically handled by connecting the GitHub repository
      # directly to the Vercel/Render dashboard. This workflow will build the application,
      # but the actual deployment trigger is usually external to GitHub Actions for these platforms.
      # For example, Vercel automatically deploys on pushes to the main branch.
