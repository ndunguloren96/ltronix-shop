Prompt for AI Agent: Django AllAuth/dj-rest-auth Settings Cleanup
Overall Objective:
The primary objective is to resolve deprecation warnings related to django-allauth and dj-rest-auth settings in the Django backend. This involves updating ecommerce/ecommerce/settings/base.py to use the modern, recommended settings for user authentication and registration fields.

Core Principles for Agent:

Accuracy and Completeness: Implement all specified changes precisely.

Maintain Functionality: Ensure user authentication, registration, and related features continue to work correctly after the changes.

Remove Deprecated Settings: Replace deprecated settings with their modern equivalents.

Instructions for File Modification:

1. File: ecommerce/ecommerce/settings/base.py
Action: Modify content.

Description: Update django-allauth and dj-rest-auth related settings to remove deprecation warnings. The core idea is to centralize user field requirements and authentication methods using ACCOUNT_LOGIN_METHODS and ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_FIELDS.

Content Details:

Locate the ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD setting:

Remove or comment out this line:

Python

# ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD = 'email' # Remove this line
Reason: This is deprecated in favor of ACCOUNT_LOGIN_METHODS.

Locate the ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED setting:

Remove or comment out this line:

Python

# ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED = True # Remove this line
Reason: This is deprecated in favor of ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_FIELDS.

Locate the ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED setting:

Remove or comment out this line:

Python

# ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED = False # Remove this line
Reason: This is deprecated in favor of ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_FIELDS.

Locate the ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_PASSWORD_ENTER_TWICE setting:

Remove or comment out this line:

Python

# ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_PASSWORD_ENTER_TWICE = True # Remove this line
Reason: This is deprecated in favor of ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_FIELDS.

Ensure ACCOUNT_LOGIN_METHODS is correctly set:

It should be:

Python

ACCOUNT_LOGIN_METHODS = ['email']
Reason: This explicitly states that users log in using their email.

Ensure ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_FIELDS is correctly set:

It should be:

Python

ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_FIELDS = ['email']
Reason: This explicitly states that only the 'email' field is required for signup. Password confirmation is handled implicitly by dj-rest-auth's serializer if ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_PASSWORD_ENTER_TWICE is not explicitly set (which we are removing).

Review dj_rest_auth.registration.serializers.py warnings:

These warnings indicate that dj-rest-auth's serializers are still referencing the old allauth settings. This is often an internal warning from the library itself, and once the allauth settings are cleaned up, these might go away, or they might persist if dj-rest-auth hasn't fully updated its internal checks. The primary fix is to ensure the allauth settings are correct.

Example of what the relevant section in base.py should look like after changes:

Python

# --- AllAuth configuration (Crucial for email-based login) ---
# ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD = 'email' # REMOVED
# ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED = True # REMOVED
# ACCOUNT_USERNAME_REQUIRED = False # REMOVED
# ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_PASSWORD_ENTER_TWICE = True # REMOVED

ACCOUNT_LOGIN_METHODS = ['email'] # Keep this
ACCOUNT_SESSION_REMEMBER = True
ACCOUNT_UNIQUE_EMAIL = True
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_VERIFICATION = 'optional'
ACCOUNT_CONFIRM_EMAIL_ON_GET = True
ACCOUNT_LOGIN_ON_EMAIL_CONFIRMATION = True
ACCOUNT_LOGOUT_ON_PASSWORD_CHANGE = True
ACCOUNT_EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX = '[Ltronix-Shop]'
# ACCOUNT_LOGIN_METHODS = ['email'] # This line is redundant if already defined above, can be removed if duplicated
ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_FIELDS = ['email'] # Keep this
ACCOUNT_RATE_LIMITS = {'login_failed': '5/5m'}
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = '/'
LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = '/'
# --- End AllAuth configuration ---
