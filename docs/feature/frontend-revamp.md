# Frontend Revamp Milestone: UI Complete & Backend Integration Prep

## Overview

This document summarizes the key achievements and architectural decisions made during the `feature/frontend-revamp` milestone for the **Ltronix E-commerce** platform. The primary goal of this milestone was to build a robust, responsive, and user-friendly frontend using **Next.js** and **Chakra UI**, preparing it for seamless integration with the Django backend.

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding the frontend's current state, its core functionalities, and the rationale behind various implementations.

## Key Achievements by Project Part

### PART 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure

- **Next.js with TypeScript**: Initialized using Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience.
- **Branching Strategy**: Development on a dedicated `feature/frontend-revamp` branch for isolated development and clean version control.
- **Core Dependencies**: Installed `@chakra-ui/react` and `@emotion/react` for UI and styling. Used `fetch` for initial API stubs instead of `axios` or `swr` for simplicity.
- **CI Stub (Planned)**: GitHub Actions workflow for linting and testing outlined, setting the stage for future automated quality checks.

### PART 2: Design System & State Management

- **Chakra UI Theme**: Implemented a centralized theme with brand colors, fonts, and spacing (e.g., Ltronix blue).
- **Reusable Components**: Created `Header`, `Footer`, `ProductCard`, and `MyModal` components for consistent UI.
- **State Store (Zustand)**: Used for managing cart state and stubbed authentication status efficiently.

### PART 3: Global Layout & Responsive Navigation

- **Root Layout (`layout.tsx`)**: Wraps pages with `ChakraProvider`, `Header`, and `Footer` for global structure.
- **Header/Navbar**:
  - Clickable Ltronix logo
  - Responsive search bar with branded button
  - Cart icon with dynamic item count
  - "Sign In" / "Sign Up" buttons
  - Hamburger menu for mobile
- **Footer**: Includes links to About, Privacy, FAQ, Contact, and a dynamic brand carousel.

### PART 4: Product Listing & Details

- **Homepage (`/`)**: Displays placeholder products in categorized grids: Recommended, Hot Deals, Trending.
- **ProductCard**: Reusable UI for product previews.
- **Product Detail Page (`/products/[id]`)**: Dynamic routing ready for backend integration.

### PART 5: Filtering & Search

- **Search Input (Header)**: Functional and redirects to `/search?q=yourquery`.
- **Search Results Page (`/search/page.tsx`)**:
  - Fetches all products from stub API `/api/products`.
  - Uses `Fuse.js` for client-side fuzzy search.
- **Search Enhancements**: Styled prominently with visible input and branded button.
- **Future Features**: Category/Brand filtering and pagination planned.

### PART 6: Authentication & Account

- **Auth Pages**: Login (`/auth/login`) and Signup (`/auth/signup`) pages stubbed.
- **Account Pages**: Dashboard, Profile, Payment, and Security pages scaffolded under `/account`.
- **Zustand Auth State**: Handles basic login/logout on frontend.
- **Planned**: Middleware + NextAuth.js for protected routes.

### PART 7: Support & Static Pages

- **Contact Page (`/support/contact`)**: Includes a form with UI validation and toast on submit.
- **FAQ Page (`/support/faq`)**: Collapsible FAQ accordion component.
- **Legal Pages**: Basic About (`/about`) and Privacy (`/privacy`) pages with SEO metadata.

### PART 8: API Stubs & Error/Loading States

- **API Stubs**: Local `/api/products` returns dummy data.
- **Loading/Error Components**: Integrated `<Spinner />` and `<Alert />` for user feedback in async operations.

### PART 9 & 10: Testing, Documentation, Design Review & Accessibility Sweep

#### Component Tests (Jest + React Testing Library)

- Set up Jest and React Testing Library.
- Created comprehensive test suite for `Header.tsx` with mocks for:
  - `useRouter`
  - Zustand cart store
  - Chakraâ€™s `useDisclosure`

#### E2E Smoke Tests (Playwright)

- Configured Playwright for E2E testing.
- Smoke tests for homepage rendering, search, and navigation flows.

#### Documentation

- **`frontend-revamp.md`**: This document.
- **`architecture.md`**: Updated with frontend architecture.
- **`dev-notes.md`**: Contains notes, known issues, and next steps.
- **`api-contract.md`**: Stub with expected API endpoints and schemas.

#### Design Review

- Ensured consistency in:
  - Typography
  - Color (Ltronix blue)
  - Spacing
  - Component visuals
- Specific tweaks: logo sizing and search bar width.

#### Accessibility Sweep (WCAG 2.2)

- Integrated `@axe-core/react` in `layout.tsx` for live a11y checks.
- Manual audits for:
  - Semantic HTML
  - Focus indicators
  - Keyboard nav
  - Alt text

## Future Work & Next Steps

With the frontend UI and core functionalities largely complete and tested, the next immediate priorities are:

- **Backend Integration**: Connect to Django APIs (products, auth, cart, orders).
- **Expanded Testing**: Add more unit and E2E tests.
- **Performance Optimization**: Tune Core Web Vitals post-integration.
- **Deployment Automation**: Finalize CI/CD pipelines.

This milestone has laid a strong foundation for the Ltronix E-commerce platform, setting the stage for a successful backend integration and a fully functional online store.
